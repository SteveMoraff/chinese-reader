I am creating a database of explanations of small groupings of Chinese words. These phrases often use individual Chinese words that can have a lot of meanings. The purpose is to allow the reader to understand the meanings of these words in their context.

Please have a look at the format of this json file. The rules for these explanations are:

1) Provide pinyin for any Chinese characters you use in the explanation.
2) Use <br> for newlines so that the newlines will appear in the div when I set the div innerHTML.
3) Explain the meanings of individual characters and/or words used in the phrases, each on their own line.
4) Phrases need to be contain two or more Chinese words. 3+ characters is also preferable. Phrases must be less than 10 characters.
5) The phrase key for the map must exactly match a block of text in the provided paragraph.
6) The output has to be formatted properly for inclusion in the attached json file.

Please look at the following paragraph and pick about 6-10 interesting or challenging phrases in it, and provide detailed explanations that use this format so that I can add them to the list.

某天清晨，公园上空的雾气尚未散去，游客们才刚刚入园。名叫莫要的男孩站在起源石前拍照，他希望同学们在社交媒体上看到他的酷照后觉得他很帅。
