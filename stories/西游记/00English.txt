The poem says:

Before chaos was divided, heaven and earth were in turmoil, vast and boundless, unseen by anyone.
Since Pangu shattered the primal chaos, clarity and murkiness have been distinguished.
All living beings are sustained by the supreme benevolence, and all things are revealed in goodness.
To understand the origin and workings of creation, you must read The Journey to the West.
It is said that the cosmic cycle consists of 129,600 years, forming one eon. Each eon is divided into twelve periods, corresponding to the twelve Earthly Branches: Zi, Chou, Yin, Mao, Chen, Si, Wu, Wei, Shen, You, Xu, and Hai. Each period lasts 10,800 years. Let's take one day as an analogy: at Zi time, yang energy begins to rise, and at Chou, the rooster crows; Yin is still dark, but at Mao, the sun rises; at Chen, people eat breakfast, and at Si, the workday starts; at noon, the sun is at its peak, and at Wei, it begins to decline; at Shen, it’s late afternoon, and at You, the sun sets; at Xu, it’s dusk, and at Hai, all is quiet. Similarly, in the great cosmic cycle, when the Xu period ends, heaven and earth will grow dim, and all things will decay. After another 5,400 years, at the start of the Hai period, darkness will prevail, and all beings will cease to exist, hence the term 'chaos.' After another 5,400 years, when the Hai period ends and the Zi period begins, creation will gradually become clearer. Shao Yong said: "At the winter solstice, at the midpoint of the Zi period, heaven's heart does not change. Yang energy first stirs, but all things have not yet come to life." At this point, heaven begins to take root. After another 5,400 years, when the Zi period is fully realized, light matter ascends, forming the sun, moon, stars, and constellations. These are called the Four Symbols. Thus, it is said that heaven was formed during the Zi period. After another 5,400 years, at the transition to the Chou period, solidity begins to take form. The I Ching says: "Great is the creative force of heaven! Supreme is the receptive force of earth! All things receive life, following heaven’s order." At this point, the earth begins to solidify. After another 5,400 years, during the Chou period, dense matter sinks, forming water, fire, mountains, stones, and earth. These are called the Five Forms. Thus, it is said that earth was formed during the Chou period. After another 5,400 years, as the Chou period ends and the Yin period begins, living things emerge. The calendar says: "Heaven’s energy descends, earth’s energy rises, and when heaven and earth meet, all living things are born." At this point, heaven becomes clear, and earth solid, yin and yang combine, and life arises. After another 5,400 years, during the Yin period, humans, animals, and birds are born. Thus, it is said that human beings were born during the Yin period.

Thanks to Pangu's efforts in creation, the Three Sovereigns ruled the world, and the Five Emperors established order. The world was then divided into four great continents: the Eastern Victory Divine Continent, the Western Niu He Continent, the Southern Jambu Continent, and the Northern Kuru Continent. This book focuses on the Eastern Victory Divine Continent. Beyond the seas, there is a land called Aolai Country. This country lies near the great ocean, and in the ocean, there is a famous mountain called the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit. This mountain is the ancestral vein of the Ten Continents and the dragon source of the Three Islands, formed after the separation of clarity and murkiness, and established after the division of the primal chaos. It is indeed a wonderful mountain, as evidenced by this ode:

Its power governs the vast ocean, its majesty calms the jade sea. The tides surge like silver mountains, and fish swim into caves. The waves crash like snowy billows, and sea creatures rise from the depths. The water and fire flow from high peaks, and in the Eastern Sea, a towering summit rises. Crimson cliffs and strange rocks, sheer walls and marvelous peaks. On the crimson cliffs, twin phoenixes sing; in front of the sheer walls, a qilin lies alone. Atop the peaks, one can hear the cries of brocade roosters, and in the stone caves, dragons come and go. In the forest are long-lived deer and immortal foxes, and in the trees are divine birds and mysterious cranes. The jade grass and rare flowers never wither, and the green pines and cypress trees are evergreen. The immortal peaches always bear fruit, and the tall bamboo reaches the clouds. Dense vines cover the ravines, and the surrounding plains are lush with new grass. This place is truly the pillar that supports all rivers and the unshakable foundation of the great earth through countless eons.
At the peak of this mountain, there is a celestial stone. The stone stands three zhang and six chi five cun high, and is two zhang four chi in circumference. The height of three zhang six chi five cun corresponds to the 365 degrees of the celestial sphere, and the circumference of two zhang four chi corresponds to the 24 solar terms. The stone has nine apertures and eight holes, corresponding to the Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams. There are no trees to provide shade around it, but rare orchids grow on its sides. Since the beginning of creation, it has absorbed the essence of heaven and earth, the energy of the sun and moon. Over time, it became infused with spiritual awareness. One day, the stone split open, and from it came an egg, round like a ball. The egg was touched by the wind and transformed into a stone monkey, complete with all five senses and four limbs. It immediately began to crawl and walk, bowing in all four directions. Two beams of golden light shot from its eyes, piercing the heavens and startling the Jade Emperor, who sat in his palace of the Golden Tower in the Cloud Palace, the Hall of Divine Mists. The celestial officials gathered, and the emperor ordered the two gods Thousand-Mile Eye and Wind-Ears to open the southern gate of heaven and investigate. The two generals carried out the command and soon returned to report: "We have observed that the golden light comes from the Eastern Victory Divine Continent, near Aolai Country, where there is a Mountain of Flowers and Fruit. On the mountain, there is a celestial stone that produced an egg, which was touched by the wind and transformed into a stone monkey. The monkey is bowing to the four directions, and its eyes are emitting golden light toward the heavens. Now, it is consuming food and water, and the golden light is subsiding." The Jade Emperor, in his great compassion, said, "This creature, born of the essence of heaven and earth, is not of great consequence."

The monkey lived in the mountains, where it could walk and jump, eat plants and drink from the streams, pick mountain flowers, and search for fruits. It befriended wolves and insects, ran with tigers and leopards, formed bonds with deer and gazelles, and became close with baboons. At night, it slept beneath the stone cliffs, and by day, it played in the caves among the peaks. Indeed, "there are no years in the mountains, and the cold passes without notice."

One day, as the weather grew hot, the monkeys sought shade beneath the pine trees and played. You could see them one by one:

Climbing trees and swinging from branches, picking flowers and searching for fruits. They threw pebbles and played catch, ran on the sandy shore, built towers, chased dragonflies, and caught cicadas. Some paid homage to the heavens, others prayed to the Buddha; some pulled vines and wove grass mats; others caught lice and bit and scratched; some cleaned their fur and picked their nails; some pushed, some pulled, some grabbed, and some tugged. They played freely beneath the green pines and washed by the clear stream.
After playing for a while, the group of monkeys went to bathe in the mountain stream. The water gushed like a rolling melon, splashing all around. The ancient saying goes: "Birds have their calls, and beasts have their speech." The monkeys said, "We don't know where this water comes from. Today, as we have nothing better to do, let’s follow the stream upstream to find its source!" With a shout, they all dragged their mates, called their brothers, and together ran along the stream, climbing the mountain until they reached the source: a waterfall and flying spring. What they saw was:

A soaring white rainbow, a thousand fathoms of snow-like waves.
The sea breeze cannot break it, and the moonlight of the river reflects its glow.
Cold air splits the green cliffs, and the remaining flow moistens the jade peaks.
The famous waterfall, like a hanging curtain, is a true spectacle.
The monkeys clapped and praised, "What wonderful water! It flows from here to the foot of the mountain and straight into the great ocean." They added, "Who among us is brave enough to jump in and find the source? Whoever does so without getting hurt, we will make our king." After calling three times, a stone monkey jumped out from the crowd, shouting, "I’ll go! I’ll go!" What a monkey! His fate was shining that day, and fortune favored him:

His fame blossomed, and great fortune followed.
He was destined to live in this place, and the gods sent him into the immortal palace.
You can see him close his eyes and squat down, then leap into the waterfall and spring. Upon opening his eyes, he saw that there was no water or waves inside, but a clear and bright bridge. He steadied himself and looked more closely; it turned out to be an iron bridge. Water flowed beneath the bridge, rushing through stone crevices and then cascading down, obscuring the bridge entrance. He carefully crossed the bridge and continued to explore. It looked like a human dwelling, a truly wonderful place. What he saw was:

Green moss piled up like jade, white clouds floating like pearls, beams of light shimmering through the mist. A quiet room with clean windows, polished benches adorned with flowers. In a milk cave hung dragon pearls, and strange flowers bloomed all over the ground. A stove by the cliff bore traces of fire, and there were jars and pots with food scraps on the table. Stone chairs and stone beds were delightful, and stone basins and stone bowls were praiseworthy. He also saw a few bamboo shoots and some plum blossoms. A few pine trees, always moist with rain, made it seem like a human dwelling.
After gazing for a long time, he jumped to the middle of the bridge and looked around. In the center, there was a stone stele with a line of large characters engraved in regular script, reading: "Blessed Land of the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit, Cave Heaven of the Water Curtain."

The stone monkey was overjoyed and hurriedly ran outside. He squatted down and jumped out of the water, laughing, "What great fortune! What great fortune!" The monkeys surrounded him and asked, "What’s it like inside? How deep is the water?" The stone monkey replied, "There’s no water! There’s no water! It’s an iron bridge, and on the other side is a house naturally formed by heaven and earth." The monkeys asked, "How do you know it’s a house?" The stone monkey laughed and said, "The water flows beneath the stone bridge, hanging down to cover the entrance. Beside the bridge, there are flowers and trees, and beyond that, there’s a stone house. Inside the house are stone basins, stone stoves, stone bowls, stone beds, and stone chairs. In the middle of the room, there’s a stone stele engraved with the words ‘Blessed Land of the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit, Cave Heaven of the Water Curtain.’ It’s truly a place for us to settle down. The space inside is vast enough to hold hundreds of families. Let’s all move in, and we’ll be free from the whims of the heavens. Inside there:

We can hide from the wind and rain, we’ll never fear frost or snow,
we’ll never hear the thunder’s roar.
The mist and clouds will always shine on us, and good omens will rise like incense.
The pine and bamboo will always flourish, and strange flowers will bloom every day."
The monkeys were delighted by this and said, "You go first and lead us inside." The stone monkey squatted down again, jumped inside, and called out, "Follow me inside, follow me inside!" The braver monkeys jumped in first, while the timid ones stretched their necks and scratched their ears, shouting loudly, but eventually, they all went in. Once inside, they scrambled for basins and bowls, stoves and beds, moving things around until they were too exhausted to continue. Finally, the stone monkey sat proudly above them and said, "Everyone, ‘without trust, one does not know what can be done.’ You all said that whoever could get in and out without harm would be made king. I’ve gone in and out, found this wonderful place for us to live in peace, so why not make me king?" The monkeys agreed and bowed down, calling him "Great King." From then on, the stone monkey ascended to kingship and dropped the character "stone" from his name, becoming known as the "Monkey King." A poem bears witness to this:

Three yangs meet, producing life; the immortal stone contains the essence of the sun and moon.
Borrowing the form of a monkey to complete the Great Way, taking on a name to achieve immortality.
Inwardly, it knows no form, outwardly, it manifests in physical shape.
Through the ages, all beings share this origin, and this one became a king, free to roam.
The Monkey King ruled over the monkeys, apes, and macaques, assigning ministers and officials. By day, they played on the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit, and by night, they rested in the Water Curtain Cave. They lived in harmony, staying away from the birds and beasts, ruling themselves with great joy. Hence:

In spring, they picked flowers to eat, in summer, they searched for fruits.
In autumn, they harvested chestnuts, and in winter, they gathered medicinal herbs.
The Monkey King enjoyed this carefree life for three to five hundred years. One day, during a joyful feast with the other monkeys, he suddenly became sad and shed tears. The monkeys hurriedly knelt down and asked, "Great King, why are you upset?" The Monkey King replied, "Though I am happy now, I have one long-term worry, which is why I’m troubled." The monkeys laughed and said, "Great King, you are truly ungrateful. We enjoy this immortal mountain and blessed land, this ancient cave and divine continent. We are free from the rule of qilins, phoenixes, and human kings. We live in peace and boundless happiness, so why are you worried?" The Monkey King replied, "Although we do not follow the laws of human kings, nor fear the might of birds and beasts, when we grow old and weak, the King of the Underworld will come for us. When we die, won’t our lives in this world be in vain? Won’t we be unable to remain among the celestial beings?" Hearing this, the monkeys all covered their faces and wept, worrying about the inevitable impermanence of life.

At this point, a long-armed ape among them jumped up and shouted, "Great King, if you have such long-term worries, it means your mind is open to the Way. Among the five creatures, there are three types that are not subject to the King of the Underworld’s control." The Monkey King asked, "Which three types?" The ape replied, "Buddhas, immortals, and saints. They escape the cycle of reincarnation, are not born nor die, and live as long as the heavens and the earth." The Monkey King asked, "Where do these three types reside?" The ape replied, "They dwell in the human world, in ancient caves and immortal mountains." Upon hearing this, the Monkey King was overjoyed and said, "Tomorrow, I will bid you farewell, and set off on a journey to the ends of the earth, to seek out these three and learn the secret of eternal life, so I may escape the grasp of the King of the Underworld." Ah! These words would lead him to break free from the cycle of reincarnation and become the Great Sage, Equal to Heaven. The monkeys clapped and cheered, saying, "Excellent, excellent! Tomorrow, we’ll climb mountains and search for fruits to prepare a great feast to send off the Great King."

The next day, the monkeys indeed gathered immortal peaches, rare fruits, wild yams, and yellow essence. Orchid, musk, and rare flowers, all kinds of treasures were laid out on stone benches and tables, with immortal wine and immortal delicacies. What they presented was:

Golden rounds and beaded fruit, red and yellow bursting forth. Golden rounds and beaded wax cherries, truly sweet and delicious; red and yellow ripe plums, fragrant and tangy. Fresh longans, sweet and thin-skinned; fiery lychees, with small seeds and red flesh. Green apples, their branches heavy with fruit; loquats, their yellow husks encased in leaves. Rabbit-head pears and chicken-heart dates, quenching thirst and relieving fatigue. Sweet peaches and ripe apricots, their sweetness like nectar; crisp plums and bayberries, tart and juicy like butter and cream. Red-bagged black-seeded watermelons, four-part yellow-skinned persimmons. Pomegranates split open, revealing fire-like crystals; chestnuts cracked open, revealing golden amber-like flesh. Walnuts and ginkgo nuts fit for tea, coconuts and grapes that make excellent wine. Hazelnuts, pines, and firs fill the plates, while oranges, sugarcane, mandarins, and lemons overflow the tables. Roasted yams and boiled yellow essence. Pounded poria and coix seeds, simmered into a fine soup over a low fire. Even the rarest delicacies of the human world cannot compare to the simple pleasures of mountain monkeys.
The monkeys honored the Monkey King, seating him at the head, while they arranged themselves in order of age. One by one, they offered him wine, flowers, and fruits, and they drank and feasted the whole day.

The next morning, the Monkey King rose early and instructed, "My little ones, gather some dead pine branches and make me a raft, cut a bamboo pole for a punt, and pack some fruits for my journey." Indeed, he boarded the raft alone, pushed off with all his strength, and drifted away on the waves, riding the wind, bound for the Southern Jambu Continent. Thus:

Heaven-born immortal monkey, with profound Daoist prowess, Leaves the mountain, rides the cloud, seizing the celestial winds.
Drifting across the seas in search of the immortal path, Determined and devoted, he builds great accomplishments.
Fated and destined, he renounces worldly desires, Carefree and untroubled, he meets the primordial dragon.
Surely destined to encounter a kindred spirit, He unveils the origins, understanding all myriad laws.
His time had come, and after boarding the raft, the southeast wind blew for days, carrying him to the northwest shore, in the territory of the Southern Jambu Continent. He tested the water with his pole, found a shallow spot, abandoned the raft, and jumped ashore. There, he saw people catching fish, hunting geese, digging for clams, and gathering salt. He approached, performed a trick, and imitated a fierce tiger, scaring the people into abandoning their baskets and nets, fleeing in all directions. He caught one who couldn’t run and stripped off his clothes, dressing himself like a human. He swaggered through the villages and towns, learning human manners and speech. He ate and slept as humans did, all the while seeking knowledge of the Way of the Buddha, immortals, and saints, searching for the secret to eternal life. But everywhere he went, he saw people consumed by the pursuit of fame and fortune, with no one concerned about their souls. It was truly:

The pursuit of fame and fortune never ends. Rising early and sleeping late, with no freedom.
Riding donkeys while dreaming of fine horses, officials striving to become kings.
Worried about food and clothing, yet unafraid of the King of the Underworld’s summons.
Passing on wealth to their children and grandchildren, with no one willing to turn back.
The Monkey King wandered for eight or nine years in the Southern Jambu Continent, visiting castles and towns, but never encountered the Way. One day, while walking by the Western Ocean, he thought that there must be immortals beyond the seas. He built another raft and sailed across the Western Sea, eventually reaching the territory of the Western Niu He Continent. He wandered there for some time before discovering a majestic mountain with deep forests. Unafraid of wolves or tigers, he climbed to the peak and marveled at the scenery. It was truly a beautiful mountain:

A thousand peaks like spears, ten thousand cliffs like screens. The sun’s rays locked in misty green, the rain’s shadows shrouded in cold blue. Thin vines clung to old trees, ancient paths led to secluded trails. Strange flowers and rare grasses, tall bamboo and towering pines. Tall bamboo and towering pines, their evergreen branches defying even the immortal land; strange flowers and rare grasses, their colors vibrant all year, outshining the isles of Penglai. Birds’ songs echoed close by, and streams flowed clear and swift. Ravines wrapped in orchids and jade, cliffs covered in moss and vines. The dragon’s pulse ran through the mountains, surely hiding someone of great wisdom.
While admiring the view, he heard voices coming from deep within the forest. Hurrying forward, he entered the woods and listened carefully. It turned out to be someone singing. The song went:

"Watching chess until the wood cracks, chopping wood with a steady rhythm, walking slowly along the valley path. Selling firewood for wine, laughing wildly to ease the heart. Walking through the autumn wilderness, resting under the pines beneath the moon, sleeping soundly until morning. Recognizing the old forest, climbing cliffs and crossing ridges, wielding an axe to cut dead vines. Gathering a load of firewood, singing as I walk to the market, exchanging it for three liters of rice. No quarrels, the price is fair. I have no schemes or worries, living a peaceful and carefree life. Wherever I meet people, they are either immortals or sages, sitting quietly and teaching the Yellow Court Classic."
The Monkey King was overjoyed and exclaimed, "So the immortals are hiding here!" He quickly leapt forward and found a woodcutter chopping wood. The woodcutter's attire was extraordinary:

On his head, he wore a straw hat made from newly sprouted bamboo. He was dressed in coarse cloth, spun from hemp. Around his waist was a belt woven from silkworm silk. On his feet, he wore straw sandals made from dry grass. In his hand, he held a steel axe, and on his back, he carried a rope made of hemp. He chopped pines and split dead wood, truly a skilled woodsman.
The Monkey King approached and called out, "Old Immortal, this disciple greets you." The woodcutter hurriedly put down his axe and returned the greeting, saying, "I am no immortal, no immortal! I’m just a poor woodcutter struggling to make ends meet. How dare I call myself an immortal?" The Monkey King replied, "If you’re not an immortal, how did you speak immortal words?" The woodcutter asked, "What immortal words did I speak?" The Monkey King said, "When I came to the edge of the forest, I heard you say, 'Wherever I meet people, they are either immortals or sages, sitting quietly and teaching the Yellow Court Classic. The Yellow Court Classic contains the true teachings of the Way; if you’re not an immortal, then what are you?" The woodcutter laughed and said, "I won’t hide the truth from you. This song is called Full Court Radiance, and an immortal taught it to me. This immortal lives next door to my house. He saw that my family life was hard and full of worries, so he taught me to recite this song whenever I’m troubled, to clear my mind and ease my burden. I was just thinking about some difficulties when I started reciting, and you happened to overhear." The Monkey King asked, "Since you live next to an immortal, why don’t you learn from him and cultivate the Way to attain immortality?" The woodcutter replied, "I’ve lived a hard life. I was raised by my parents until I was eight or nine years old, but unfortunately, my father passed away, and my mother was left a widow. I have no siblings, so I had no choice but to care for her. Now that my mother is old, I dare not leave her. Our land has gone to waste, and we lack food and clothing. I have to chop firewood and sell it in the market for a few coins to buy some rice. I cook and take care of my mother myself, so I have no time to cultivate the Way."

The Monkey King said, "You’re a filial son, and in the future, you’ll surely be rewarded for it. But I hope you can tell me where this immortal lives, so I can pay him a visit." The woodcutter replied, "It’s not far, not far. This mountain is called the Mountain of Spirit and Thought. In the mountain, there is a cave called the Cave of the Three Stars and the Slanted Moon. Inside the cave lives an immortal named Subhuti Patriarch. Many disciples have already left his tutelage, and now there are about thirty or forty left learning from him. Follow this small path and head south for about seven or eight miles, and you’ll find his place." The Monkey King grabbed the woodcutter’s arm and said, "Brother, come with me. If I gain any benefit, I will never forget your guidance." The woodcutter replied, "You really don’t understand. Didn’t I just explain to you? If I go with you, who will take care of my business? Who will look after my mother? I must chop firewood. You go on your own."

Hearing this, the Monkey King had no choice but to bid farewell. He left the deep forest, found the path, and crossed a mountain ridge. After about seven or eight miles, he indeed saw a cave dwelling. It was a truly wonderful place! What he saw was:

Mist and clouds scattered in a rainbow of colors, the sun and moon shining brightly. A thousand ancient cypress trees, ten thousand tall bamboo groves. A thousand ancient cypress trees, their blue-green leaves glistening with rain; ten thousand tall bamboo groves, their verdant stems shrouded in mist. Outside the gate, strange flowers bloomed like brocade, and by the bridge, jade grass exuded fragrance. The stone cliffs were covered in green moss, and the hanging walls were adorned with long vines. At times, the cry of an immortal crane could be heard, and often, a phoenix could be seen soaring. The cry of the immortal crane echoed far beyond the sky; the flight of the phoenix radiated five-colored clouds of light. Mysterious apes and white deer appeared and disappeared, while golden lions and jade elephants roamed freely. Upon closer inspection, this blessed land was truly like paradise.
He saw that the cave door was tightly closed, with no one in sight. He turned around and saw a stone stele standing over three zhang tall and eight chi wide. On it, ten large characters were engraved: "Mountain of Spirit and Thought, Cave of the Three Stars and the Slanted Moon." The Monkey King was overjoyed and said, "These people are so honest; there really is such a mountain and such a cave." He gazed at it for a long time, but did not dare to knock on the door. Instead, he climbed up a pine branch and amused himself by eating pine nuts.

After a short while, he heard a creaking sound as the cave door opened. A young immortal boy emerged, truly elegant and dignified, with a face unlike that of an ordinary person. What he saw was:

His hair was tied in two silk knots, and his wide sleeves flowed in the wind.
His appearance and body were unique, his heart and mind both empty.
He was a guest from beyond the world, an eternal child of the mountains.
Free from worldly dust, he lived through countless ages.
The boy came out and called loudly, "Who is causing trouble here?" The Monkey King leaped down from the tree, bowed, and said, "Immortal boy, I am a disciple seeking the Way. I have not come to cause trouble." The boy laughed and said, "Are you seeking the Way?" The Monkey King replied, "Yes." The boy said, "My master just descended from his platform and is about to begin his lecture. Before he started, he told me to open the door and receive a visitor seeking the Way. That must be you, right?" The Monkey King smiled and said, "It is indeed me." The boy said, "Follow me inside."

The Monkey King straightened his clothes, composed himself, and followed the boy deep into the cave. What he saw was layer upon layer of pavilions and palaces, and courtyard after courtyard of jade palaces and pearl towers. Words cannot describe the serene chambers and secluded dwellings. Finally, they arrived at the Jade Terrace, where the Patriarch Subhuti was seated on a platform, with thirty small immortals standing on either side. What he saw was:

The Great Enlightened Golden Immortal, free from all impurities, the Patriarch Subhuti of the Western Pure Land.
Neither born nor perishing, with perfect conduct, full of qi and spirit, boundless in compassion.
Empty and still, he transforms according to circumstance, following the true nature of all things.
His body, as grand as the heavens, has endured countless eons, a great master of the Dharma.
The Monkey King saw him and immediately prostrated himself, kowtowing repeatedly, saying, "Master, master, your disciple pays homage to you with a sincere heart, with a sincere heart." The Patriarch said, "Where are you from? State your place of origin and your name before bowing." The Monkey King replied, "I am from the Water Curtain Cave on the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit in Aolai Country, on the Eastern Victory Divine Continent." The Patriarch shouted, "Throw him out! He’s just a trickster, unworthy of cultivating the Way!" The Monkey King hastily kowtowed, saying, "Master, I am sincere; there is no deception in my words." The Patriarch said, "If you’re sincere, how did you manage to come from the Eastern Victory Divine Continent? That place is separated from here by two great oceans, with the Southern Jambu Continent in between. How did you get here?" The Monkey King kowtowed and said, "I crossed the seas, wandered through various lands, and spent more than ten years on this journey before I finally found this place."

The Patriarch said, "Since you came gradually, that’s fine. What is your surname?" The Monkey King replied, "I have no surname. If someone insults me, I don’t get angry; if someone hits me, I don’t get upset. I just offer a bow and that’s it. I’ve been without a surname all my life." The Patriarch said, "That’s not the kind of surname I’m talking about. What was your original family name?" The Monkey King said, "I have no parents." The Patriarch said, "If you have no parents, then perhaps you were born from a tree?" The Monkey King replied, "I wasn’t born from a tree, but I was born from a stone. I only remember that on the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit, there was a celestial stone. One year, the stone split open, and I was born." Hearing this, the Patriarch was secretly pleased and said, "So you were born of heaven and earth. Stand up and walk around so I can take a look." The Monkey King leaped up and walked back and forth twice. The Patriarch laughed and said, "Your body may be humble, but you resemble a monkey that eats pine nuts. I will give you a surname based on your appearance. Let’s call you 'Hu' (monkey). If we remove the animal radical from 'Hu,' we get 'Gu' (ancient moon). 'Gu' means old, and 'moon' represents yin. Old yin cannot produce life, so 'Sun' would be better. If we remove the animal radical from 'Sun,' we get 'Zi,' which means 'son' or 'child.' It fits perfectly with the idea of a child, so I will give you the surname 'Sun'." The Monkey King was overjoyed and kowtowed, saying, "Good! Good! Good! Now I finally have a surname. I beg you, Master, since I have a surname, please give me a name as well, so I may be properly addressed." The Patriarch said, "In my sect, we have twelve characters for names, assigned in order. You are my tenth disciple, so your name will follow the 'Wu' character." The Monkey King asked, "What are the twelve characters?" The Patriarch replied, "They are Guang, Da, Zhi, Hui, Zhen, Ru, Xing, Hai, Ying, Wu, Yuan, and Jue." He continued, "Since your name falls under the 'Wu' character, I will give you the name 'Sun Wukong' (Awakened to Emptiness). How does that sound?" The Monkey King smiled and said, "Good! Good! Good! From now on, I shall be called Sun Wukong." Indeed:

At the dawn of creation, there was no surname, but by breaking through ignorance, one must awaken to emptiness.
What path Sun Wukong will follow in his cultivation remains to be seen. Listen to the next chapter to find out.
