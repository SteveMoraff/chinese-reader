Chapter 2: Night Out in Shanghai

The night had fallen, and Shanghai's streets began to perform their unique neon rhapsody. Skyscrapers stood like swords piercing the hazy dusk, while the lights of the streets flickered like stars, turning the city into an endless light show. Amid this interplay of shadow and light, a metallic SUV slowly approached, its low engine growl like the pulsating beat of heavy metal, causing nearby street food stalls to tremble, their tofu puddings quivering in their bowls.

"Make way! Make way! The urban king has arrived!" Zhu Bajie gripped the steering wheel with one hand, tapping the gas pedal lightly with his foot. The confidence in his eyes seemed to declare that the entire street was designed as his personal racetrack. His sunglasses sparkled under the neon lights, like stage lights cutting through the night, constantly reflecting the admiration he believed was his due.

This SUV was no ordinary vehicle either. Its front bumper resembled a roaring lion, and gold-plated prayer beads dangled from the rearview mirror. Zhu Bajie proudly called it his "urban war chariot," though it resembled more of a "nightmare for traffic regulations." But he didn’t care; to him, those rules were merely "gentle suggestions."

At the exact moment the traffic light turned red, Zhu Bajie slammed on the brakes, causing the SUV’s front wheels to spark bright orange against the asphalt. A middle-aged woman on an electric scooter next to him widened her eyes in shock. “Scared me half to death! Driving like this in the middle of the night?” Zhu Bajie rolled down his window, took off his sunglasses, and flashed a grin bright enough to double as a streetlight. “Don’t worry, you’re still alive and kicking, aren’t you?”

"That's right! That's exactly what I mean!" Pigsy bellowed into his phone, his voice shaking the entire street. His ludicrously oversized SUV wedged itself into a space barely big enough for a single e-bike, forcing its way in with a grating metallic screech. The car, like a barber with giant scissors, "snipped" a streetlight pole, bending it as if it were made of paper. "I said six thousand shares of Fatty Fashions, not five thousand! Do I need to spell it out in pinyin for you?"  

He stomped on the gas, and the engine roared, drowning out the startled cries of pedestrians and the blaring of car horns. The era of electric vehicles might be dawning, but for Pigsy, only the primal thrill of an internal combustion engine's roar could cement his status as the urban king. Using city infrastructure as a prop only made the thrill more satisfying.  

"Don't let the noise scare you," Pigsy chuckled into the phone, glancing at the streetlight pole lying on the sidewalk like a tree felled by Wu Song. Pedestrians stepped over it, some filming, others rolling their eyes. "It's just a small thing—a streetlight taking a nap."  

After hanging up, he casually adjusted his mirrored sunglasses, which gleamed as if they could disrupt signals in a space station. He sank into his leather seat and admired himself in the rearview mirror: a suit so purple it looked like a regal grape, a gold chain flashy enough to embarrass a hip-hop star, and hair gel stiffened like reinforced concrete, holding his hair skyward with confidence.  

"Tsk, Pigsy, you just get better-looking every time." He nodded at his reflection, a crooked grin revealing a hint of tusks. "Shanghai has no idea what real swagger looks like yet."  

He stepped out of the car, his American alligator cowboy boots landing in a shallow puddle he had somehow created while parking. The splash sent murky water flying, like understated fireworks celebrating his entrance. A valet approached hesitantly, his face a mix of "I don't want to get involved" and "I have no choice." His gaze flickered between the toppled streetlight and the Transformer-like SUV.  

"Uh, sir, I think you might have—" the valet began, trying to sound diplomatic, as if addressing a ticking time bomb.  

"No need to thank me!" Pigsy interrupted with a wave of his hand, as if announcing a great honor. Tossing his keys like they were a hot potato, he passed them to the valet. "Take care of it. It has a habit of redecorating the streetscape—don't let it go to waste."  

The valet froze, holding the keys, staring at the SUV that looked like a small tank, then at the pitiful streetlight. His lips moved: "But sir, I don't think—"  

"Exactly!" Pigsy clapped the valet on the shoulder with the confidence of a boss encouraging an intern. "Don't overthink it. Just admire the art!" With that, he strode toward the lavishly decorated restaurant, leaving a trail of confusion behind.  

The restaurant was the pinnacle of Shanghai's dining scene, with a golden door, a red carpet so polished it reflected passersby, and a doorman wearing an expression that screamed, "I shouldn't even be here." Everything about it exuded luxury and exclusivity. As Pigsy approached, the hostess's well-trained smile faltered for a moment, clearly struggling to process the combination of "eccentric outfit + galactic-level presence."  

"Welcome to Shanghai Palace," she said, forcing her expression back into polite neutrality with a slight bow. "Do you have a reservation?"  

"Of course!" Pigsy's eyes sparkled like flashlights. "I booked a table for ten under 'The Magnificent Mr. Pig.' I never do surprise visits—got it?"  

The hostess frowned slightly as she scrolled through her tablet, her tightly knit brows resembling someone trying to crack an encrypted code. "I'm sorry, sir, but I can't seem to find—"  

"Ah, technology!" Pigsy shook his head theatrically, snatching the tablet. "Let me help you!" Before she could protest, he swung his arm, sending the tablet soaring in a graceful arc before it landed with a splash in a nearby fish tank housing expensive koi. Water splashed everywhere, leaving both the fish and the device in an awkward underwater symphony.  

"Oops, slippery hands!" Pigsy exclaimed with mock surprise, as if he'd just performed a daring circus act. "But look at that big red koi! Jumping so lively—it'll make a great appetizer. Freshness is key, right?" He reached into the tank, fished out the flopping koi, and tossed it to the stunned hostess.  

"Here you go, hurry up and prepare it!" he said, his tone as casual as if he were ordering a cup of tea. The hostess, dripping wet and holding the wriggling fish, likely had a mental alarm already ringing. "Sir, I must insist—" But before she could finish, Pigsy had already disappeared into the restaurant.  

"No need to thank me!" his voice echoed from afar. "Just streamlining your menu!"  

In the center of the restaurant stood a massive table, perfect for boisterous banquets. Pigsy plopped himself down in the middle, like an emperor surveying his domain. Other diners shielded their faces with menus or discreetly snapped photos, as if watching an absurdist play.  

A waiter approached cautiously, his voice trembling with uncertainty. "Good evening, sir. Would you like to see the menu?"  

"Menu?" Pigsy waved dismissively, grinning like a celebrity striking a pose. "I've already seen it!" He grabbed the high-end menu from the table, flipped through it at lightning speed, and said, "Ah, no need to waste time. Bring me one of everything!" He paused, then added, "No, make that two of everything! It's a festive day—I want the kitchen to understand the meaning of 'truly busy!'"  

The waiter's eyes widened. "Every dish, sir?"  

"You heard me! Every dish, two of each. I'm feeling generous. Today is a day to celebrate!"  

"Very well, sir," the waiter replied, mentally calculating how many trips to the kitchen this would take.  

As the waiter hurried off, Pigsy leaned back in his chair, draping his arms over the backrest like a king overseeing his kingdom. His phone vibrated, and he glanced at the screen. It was a message from his wife, Gao Cuilan.  

"Don't forget we have dinner with the financial advisor tonight. It's important."  

He rolled his eyes and muttered, "Always these 'important' things." He quickly typed a reply: "Busy right now, in a meeting."  

Almost instantly, another message popped up. "Is your 'meeting' just another excuse for feasting?"  

He chuckled, slipping the phone into his pocket. "She knows me too well."

In no time, the dishes began arriving one after another, with exquisite delicacies laid out before him. Steaming baskets of dumplings, sizzling stir-fried dishes, and aromatic bowls of soup quickly filled his table.

“Ah, truly a feast for the senses!” Zhu Bajie cheered, clapping his hands. He picked up his chopsticks and ate heartily, as if the food might grow legs and run away at any moment.

At the next table, a little girl stared at him in astonishment. “Mom, is that man going to eat all of that?”

Her mother gently stopped her. “Don’t stare, dear, it’s impolite.”

Zhu Bajie overheard their conversation, turned his head, and smiled at them. “It’s alright! Curiosity is a sign of intelligence.” He picked up a dumpling and offered it to the girl. “Would you like to share? There’s plenty!”

The girl’s mother blushed with embarrassment. “Oh, no, we couldn’t—”

“Don’t be shy! Food tastes better when shared.” He waved his large hand, accidentally knocking over a vase, which shattered on the floor. “Oops! Add that to my bill!”

The manager appeared out of nowhere, his smile a bit strained. “Sir, is everything to your satisfaction?”

“Absolutely delicious!” Zhu Bajie said, slurping his noodles loudly. “But I must say, the atmosphere could use more excitement. Perhaps some live music? A dance floor?”

“I’ll consider it,” the manager replied, his gaze falling on the growing stack of empty plates. “Is there anything else I can do for you?”

“Actually, there is!” Zhu Bajie snapped his fingers. “Bring me your best baijiu. Keep it coming!”

“Of course, sir.”

As the manager left, Zhu Bajie’s phone buzzed again. Another message from his wife: “We need to talk. Tonight.”

He sighed and pushed the phone aside. “Always so serious,” he muttered, downing a glass of baijiu in one gulp. “Can’t a man just enjoy himself?”

At that moment, a group of businessmen at a nearby table raised their glasses. “To success!” one of them proposed.

“To luxury!” Zhu Bajie chimed in loudly, raising his own glass. The businessmen looked over, puzzled.

“Uh, cheers?” one of them responded hesitantly.

“That’s the spirit!” Zhu Bajie laughed, draining his glass in one go.

At a more distant table, an elderly couple looked at him disapprovingly. “So greedy,” the old woman whispered. “It’s disgraceful.”

Her husband nodded. “Money can’t buy manners.”

Zhu Bajie pretended not to hear, but their words pricked a corner of his heart. He shrugged and called for the waiter.

“More dumplings! And bring some desserts. Life’s too short—dessert comes first!”

The waiter nodded, quickly jotting it down. “Right away, sir.”

While waiting for the next round of food, Zhu Bajie glanced around the restaurant. Families were chatting, couples were holding hands, and friends were laughing. Despite the feast before him, he felt a lingering emptiness.

His phone buzzed again. “If you don’t show up tonight, don’t bother coming home,” read the message from his wife.

He sighed heavily and stuffed a piece of roast duck into his mouth. “She’s never satisfied!” he grumbled.

A young man cautiously approached his table. “Excuse me, sir. I’m a big fan of yours. I really enjoyed your interview in Wealth and Luxury magazine.”

Zhu Bajie perked up. “Ah, a man of taste! Please, have a seat and join me!”

“Oh, I couldn’t—”

“I insist!” Zhu Bajie said, pulling out a chair. “Tell me, what’s your secret to success?”

The young man sat down awkwardly. “Well, I’m just starting out, hoping to learn from someone like you.”

Zhu Bajie patted him on the back. “Lesson one: don’t hope—go after it! The world is your buffet, my friend.”

“Interesting philosophy,” the young man said, eyeing the mountain of food.

“Care for some caviar?” Zhu Bajie offered him a plate.

“Thank you, but I’m allergic to it.”

"Then there's more for me!" Zhu Bajie shrugged and continued eating heartily.

After a few awkward exchanges, the young man made an excuse to leave. "Uh, I need to get back to my colleague."

"Remember what I said!" Zhu Bajie shouted after him. "Conquer the world with chopsticks!"

He laughed loudly at his own joke, but the laughter quickly faded. The more he ate, the less satisfied he felt.

The manager returned and cleared his throat. "Sir, we've been informed there’s an issue with your payment."

Zhu Bajie looked up, surprised. "An issue? Impossible. Try it again."

"We’ve already tried three times, sir. Do you have cash?"

"That’s impossible." Zhu Bajie felt a bead of cold sweat form on his forehead. He took out his phone, only to see a glaring red notification: **Account Frozen—Please Contact Your Bank.**

"What’s this..." He angrily dialed the bank. After a series of holds and transfers, a customer service representative finally answered.

"Mr. Zhu, your account has been temporarily frozen due to suspicious activity."

"Suspicious activity? I *am* the suspicious activity!"

"Apologies, sir, but the freeze was authorized by your co-account holder."

He groaned. "Gao Cuilan," he muttered under his breath. "Fine. I’ll deal with it later."

He hung up and looked at the manager, who was waiting expectantly. "Just a small misunderstanding. How about I sign an IOU?"

The manager’s smile was frosty. "I’m afraid we require immediate payment."

Zhu Bajie glanced around and noticed the entire restaurant seemed to be watching him. His ears turned red—a rare occurrence. "Maybe we can strike a deal. Free meals for life in exchange for my endorsement?"

"Tempting, but no."

Before Zhu Bajie could respond, his phone rang again. It was his wife.

Reluctantly, he answered. "Hello?"

"Enjoying your 'meeting'?" Her tone was sharp.

"Listen, I can explain—"

"Don’t bother. Bajie, I’ve had enough. Come home now, or don’t come back at all."

The call ended abruptly.

He stared at his phone, a sinking feeling in his chest unrelated to the feast he’d just had.

The manager cleared his throat again. "Sir?"

Zhu Bajie slowly stood up. "Looks like I’m in a bit of trouble."

"You certainly are."

He reached into his pocket and pulled out a heavy, diamond-encrusted watch. "This should cover it."

The manager skeptically examined the watch. "This isn’t a pawn shop."

Zhu Bajie sighed. For the first time in years, he felt... defeated.

The manager’s patience was wearing thin. "Sir, if you can’t pay, we’ll have to involve the authorities."

Zhu Bajie’s mind raced. "Look, there’s been a misunderstanding. My account is temporarily inaccessible. Maybe we can work out another solution?"

The manager crossed his arms. "Unless you have someone who can pay for you, there’s nothing I can do."

At that moment, a familiar voice called out from across the restaurant. "Is there a problem here?"

They all turned to see a distinguished gentleman approaching. It was Mr. Chen, an old acquaintance of Zhu Bajie.

"Mr. Chen?" Zhu Bajie said, surprised.

"Ah, Mr. Zhu! What a coincidence," Mr. Chen replied warmly. He glanced at the manager. "Is there an issue?"

The manager sighed. "This gentleman is unable to settle his bill."

Mr. Chen raised an eyebrow. "I’m sure this is just a temporary setback." He pulled out a platinum credit card. "Allow me to cover it."

Zhu Bajie protested, "I can’t accept this—it’s too generous."

"Don't mention it," Mr. Chen insisted. "You've done a lot for the community. Think of this as a small token of my appreciation."

The manager hesitated for a moment before accepting the card. "Alright, sir. I'll take care of it right away."

After the manager left, Zhu Bajie turned to Mr. Chen. "I don't even know how to thank you."

Mr. Chen smiled kindly. "Everyone needs help at some point. Maybe someday, you can pay it forward."

Zhu Bajie nodded, feeling a mix of relief and shame. "I will."

He forced a faint smile. "Thank you."

As he left the restaurant, he felt the stares of the diners following him like spotlights. Outside, the city remained bustling and vibrant, oblivious to his troubles.

Walking to his car, he noticed a ticket on the windshield and a boot on the wheel. "Perfect," he muttered.

The valet boy from earlier approached cautiously. "Sir, about your car..."

Zhu Bajie rubbed his temples. "Are there any taxis nearby?"

"Just over there," the boy pointed to the end of the street.

"Thanks," Zhu Bajie said, slipping him a gold cufflink. "For your trouble."

The valet boy stared at the cufflink, then at Zhu Bajie. "Good luck, sir."

In the taxi, Zhu Bajie gazed out at the flashing Shanghai lights. The city seemed less dazzling tonight, its colors dimmed.

He thought of the restaurant, the manager, Mr. Chen, and his wife's stern words. A hollow feeling lingered in his chest, deeper than hunger.

The taxi driver glanced at him in the rearview mirror. "Rough night?"

"You could say that," Zhu Bajie replied.

"Sometimes, it's not what you have but who's by your side," the driver said.

"Are you a philosopher or a taxi driver?"

"Why can't I be both?" the driver chuckled.

They arrived at his lavish home—a grand estate that seemed out of place in the city.

"We're here," the driver announced.

Zhu Bajie paid the fare and stood at the door for a moment before going inside. The house was dark except for a lamp in the living room.

He walked in to find his wife on the couch with a stack of documents.

"You're late," she said without looking up.

"Ran into some... trouble."

She met his gaze. "Bajie, we need to talk."

He sat across from her, the day's exhaustion weighing on him. "I know."

She took a deep breath, her eyes steady. "I've frozen the accounts. I can't watch you squander our life anymore. This can't go on."

He nodded slowly, attempting a guilty smile. "I understand."

Her eyebrows arched. "Do you really understand?"

"Yes. Today was eye-opening," he thought of the booted car and unpaid bill.

She sighed in exasperation. "Alright, that's a first. But understanding isn't enough." She pulled out a thick stack of papers from her bag. "These are divorce papers. Surprise!"

He blinked. "Divorce? Isn't that a bit extreme? I mean, we all have bad days."

"Bad days?" She scoffed. "Your 'bad day' has lasted three years. Consider this your official eviction notice." She shoved the papers into his hands.

He looked down at the papers, then back at her. "You're not serious."

"Oh, I'm serious. And with your accounts frozen, good luck finding a lawyer," she said with a sly smile. "Now, pack your things and go. The only pork I need in this house is in the fridge."

He opened his mouth to protest, but she raised a finger. "Ah! Save the sweet talk. I'm immune to your charm—just like the takeout in the fridge, it's expired."

She pushed him toward the door. He made one last plea. "Cuilan, can't we sit down and talk this out? I'll let you pick the restaurant this time!"

She rolled her eyes, opening the door with a dramatic flourish. "Goodbye, Bajie. Don't let the door hit you on the way out."

He stood outside, looking back at her. "You can't kick me out! This is my house too!"

She sneered. "Correction: this is my house. Check the deed."

"I won't..." Zhu Bajie started, but the roar of an engine cut him off. They turned to see a flashy red convertible speeding around the corner, music blasting. Before Zhu Bajie could react, the car skidded to a stop, and he was yanked off his feet, landing face-first in the passenger seat.

"Hey! What the—!" He struggled to sit up.

The driver, wearing aviator sunglasses and a sharp suit, glanced at him casually. "Oh, hey, Bajie! Fancy meeting you here!"

"Sun Wukong?!" Zhu Bajie recognized the Great Sage himself behind the wheel.

"The one and only!" Wukong grinned. Cuilan stood at the doorway, smiling faintly.

"Good to see you again, Cuilan!" Wukong called, barely slowing the car.

"Wait a minute!" Zhu Bajie protested. "I haven't agreed to—"

Before he could finish, Wukong floored the gas, and the car shot down the street. Zhu Bajie clung to the door for dear life as they weaved through traffic.

"Is this even legal?!" Zhu Bajie shouted over the wind.

"Legal? Where's the fun in that?" Wukong laughed. "Besides, I have immunity—or is it impunity? Always mix those up."

Back at the house, Cuilan watched them disappear into the distance. She shook her head, chuckling. "Well, at least now he's someone else's problem." She closed the door and let out a sigh of relief.

Meanwhile, speeding through the city streets, Zhu Bajie tried to steady his nerves. "Wukong, what are you doing here?"
