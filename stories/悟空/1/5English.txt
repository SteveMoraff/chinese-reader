Chapter One: The Rise of Sun Wukong — Apartment Dweller and Car Enthusiast

In a bustling region of eastern China, there was a coastal community called Aoshan Manor, located on the outskirts of a second-tier city. This was the kind of place that real estate agents raved about in every brochure as “the perfect blend of natural beauty and urban convenience.” Built just a few years ago, the community featured brand-new high-rise apartments, numerous convenience stores, and a massive roundabout that no one quite knew how to use. But what really attracted visitors from all around, making them rush to take selfies, was the Huaguo Mountain National Park.

Within the park stood a towering waterfall, lush greenery, and the famous Origin Stone—a giant rock perched on the edge of a cliff. Legend had it that this stone had been there since the dawn of time, blessed by the gods. Some said it symbolized fertility, while others claimed it was a secret landing spot for aliens. Regardless, it had become a must-see spot for influencers chasing the perfect photo. And this is where things started to get strange.

One misty morning, as the fog had yet to clear and the first visitors were trickling into the park, Mo Yao stood in front of the Origin Stone, snapping photos. He hoped his classmates would think he looked cool when they saw the pictures on social media.

Just then, an elderly woman approached Mo Yao. She beamed at him and asked, "Young man, would you like me to take a full-body photo of you?" Mo Yao hesitated for a moment, but then thought it might be a good idea and nodded. "Thank you, I appreciate it."

The elderly woman took the phone, expertly opening the camera mode. Her eyes held an ancient wisdom, as if she could see through the depths of time, but her words caught Mo Yao completely off guard. "Come on, give me a 'so hype' pose, and don't forget to add a 'wage slave, no worries' expression!" Mo Yao couldn't help but burst into laughter. "Granny, you're really up to date with the trends, huh?"

As she snapped the pictures, the elderly woman laughed, "Ah, young people think we old folks can only dance in the public squares every night, but we also know about 'like with sincerity, comment with gusto'!" Suddenly, she paused, grabbed Mo Yao's hand, and carefully examined his palm. "Hmm... I see a journey, a place you've never been to, and a strange new friend. Oh my, it's Shanghai!" she whispered, her eyes flashing with a hint of mystery. "I've heard it's been quite lively there lately, especially with some heavenly figures frequently visiting." Mo Yao laughed even more, completely oblivious to the subtle meaning hidden in the old woman's gaze.

After taking the photo, the elderly woman handed the phone back to Mo Yao, patted him on the shoulder, and said, "Remember, today's photo is going to go viral, and you better be ready for what's coming next." There was a mysterious tone to her words, which made Mo Yao pause. "What's coming next? What do you mean?" He didn't have time to ask further, as the old woman had already walked away with a bright smile, her steps light for someone of her age.

Mo Yao looked down at the photo on his phone and muttered to himself, "What does she mean by what's coming next... Shanghai? Heavenly figures? What's she talking about?" He frowned, a bit curious, but shrugged and smiled, dismissing it as just an amusing old lady's joke. Yet, deep down, he had a sense that this was more than just a joke—it felt like some kind of strange omen.

At that moment, the stone began to crack. Initially, the park rangers assumed it was just weathering, but before anyone could even pull out a selfie stick, the stone suddenly shattered with a loud “bang.” Out jumped a fully grown Sun Wukong—he was wearing a black hoodie with the “Banana Republic” logo, ripped jeans, and a pair of clearly fake designer sunglasses bought from a street vendor. He yawned, stretched, and acted as if he had just woken up from a long nap, while Mo Yao stood behind him, utterly stunned.

“Man, it was cramped in there,” Wukong muttered as he looked around. The tourists were frozen in place, gawking at him in disbelief. The rangers weren’t sure whether to call security or hand him a park map. Wukong lightly leapt onto Mo Yao’s head, instantly creating a viral moment for all the visitors who uploaded it to social media.

Sun Wukong wasn’t just any ordinary person—that much he knew. Formed from the essence of heaven and earth, he was unique. As he realized he had become the center of attention, with the sound of camera shutters clicking and the constant honking of cars in the distance, he knew he still had much to learn.

He strolled out of the park, avoiding the souvenir shops because he couldn’t understand why humans would pay so much for a “limited edition” rock magnet. Eventually, he arrived at the nearby luxurious apartment complex, Waterfall Garden. Built into the cliffs with a waterfall as the backdrop, the ads promised “the perfect fusion of waterfront living and urban convenience.” Wukong saw this and smirked—the layout felt oddly familiar to him. Living in an apartment behind a waterfall? Right up his alley.

After a brief chat with the landlord, the man was so amazed by Wukong’s casual backflip that he skipped the background check entirely. Wukong moved into a spacious unit with floor-to-ceiling windows that overlooked the waterfall.

It didn’t take long for Wukong to adapt to modern life. He quickly picked up essential skills: food delivery apps, binge-watching TV shows, and enjoying the delights of hotpot. He particularly loved messing with his neighbors, who could never figure out why their Wi-Fi cut out during important work calls. Sometimes he helped tend the communal garden, and other times he threw wild parties, leaving banana peels scattered around the pool.

But Wukong’s favorite discovery was cars. He spent countless hours watching car review videos and gradually fell in love with speed and flashy rides. Eventually, he walked straight into the local luxury car dealership.

“I need a car that makes me feel... powerful,” he said, smiling at the puzzled salesman. Minutes later, Wukong drove off in a shiny red convertible, the wind blowing through his fur—which now looked more like hair, as he preferred to style it that way. The music in the car was deafening, loud enough to make passersby turn their heads. He sped through the streets as if the entire city belonged to him, ignoring all speed limits and treating traffic lights as mere suggestions. His neighbors had long since gotten used to it. After all, Wukong had an irresistible charm. When he wasn’t speeding through the city, he parked his convertible by the apartment pool and hosted BBQ parties, becoming the talk of Aoshan Manor. His secret? Caramel-drizzled grilled bananas. “Family recipe,” he’d say with a wink.

Life was good. Maybe too good.

One peaceful afternoon, Wukong lay lazily on his balcony and found himself tearing up. The neighbors gossiped, wondering why Wukong seemed sad, while he scrolled through his social media. Suddenly, an ad popped up: “Seeking talented immortals to join the Heavenly Court for bigger, better opportunities. Generous benefits. Inquire with the Celestial HR Department.”

“Immortals?” Wukong stroked his chin. “I came out of a rock, so that should count.” He leaned back in his chair and gazed at the waterfall. He liked apartment life, but the idea of getting an official title, a job in the Heavenly Court? That sounded intriguing. Besides, the police were starting to crack down on his driving habits. It was time to aim for something bigger.

Having made up his mind, Wukong packed his essentials—his phone, charger, and sunglasses—and hit the road in his convertible. He didn’t have much of a plan, but that wasn’t his style. He thought he’d head to the nearest temple and give it a try. Surely, the Celestial HR Department would accept walk-ins, right?

As Wukong drove his red convertible out of town, a red light appeared ahead. “Hmm, is a red light a suggestion or a rule?” he muttered, pressing down on the gas pedal, ready to blow through it. Just then, a familiar figure appeared on the crosswalk—Mo Yao! Wukong slammed on the brakes, the car screeching to a halt mere inches from Mo Yao.

“Do you even know how to drive?!” Mo Yao shouted, one hand holding his phone while the other rested on his hip, glaring at Wukong.

“Ahh! My bad, my bad!” Wukong jumped out of the car, bowing repeatedly. “My mind was completely on the Heavenly Realm just now! Are you okay? I can compensate with bananas… uh, I mean medical expenses!”

“The Heavenly Realm? What on earth are you talking about?” Mo Yao asked suspiciously, crossing his arms. “Did you get hit on the head or something?”

Wukong scratched the back of his head nervously. “No, no, my head’s really hard—but that’s not the point! The point is, I’m heading off to apply for a job in the Heavenly Realm!”

Mo Yao frowned, crossing his arms tighter. “That sounds ridiculous. Who even are you? The guy who popped out of a rock last time, and now you’re speeding around town?”

“I’m none other than the legendary Monkey King, Sun Wukong!” Wukong thumped his chest proudly. “But right now, I’m just an ordinary monkey… uh, person who likes convertibles.”

“Ordinary? You nearly killed me just now and you call that ordinary?” Mo Yao rolled his eyes dramatically.

Wukong quickly pressed his palms together apologetically. “I’m sorry, I’m sorry! I really mean it! To make it up to you, I can give you a ride anywhere—name the place!”

“Anywhere?” Mo Yao grinned mischievously. “Alright, then I’m coming with you to the Heavenly Realm. There’s no way I’m missing something this bizarre!”

Wukong’s eyes widened in disbelief. “You? Coming to the Heavenly Realm with me? This is an adventure, not a vacation! Are you sure?”

“Absolutely!” Mo Yao plopped himself down in the passenger seat, patting the car roof. “You need a reliable navigator, or you’re just going to end up getting arrested for running red lights.”

Wukong sighed and started the engine. “Alright, fine, come along! But you’d better hold on tight—this car’s seriously fast!”

Mo Yao buckled his seatbelt and pointed ahead. “First, stop at red lights and go on green, thank you! You’ve got to learn to follow the rules first, Great Sage!”

Wukong burst into laughter, and the car sped off, leaving behind a trail of commotion as the two set off on their extraordinary adventure.
